Optimiztions

-only access odd numbers in the list

-hardcode 2 as a prime every time

-only mark false odd multiples of the number we're looking at to
reduce cache misses

-wrote our own implementation so some instructions may be in a 
different order

-use add instruction instead of mood since add is an ALU instruction
and mov is an other instruction

-reduced the number of jumps and branches

-used bytes for booleans but considered using bits, since we minimized 
cache misses we did not implement this idea
instead of slt we use div and bnez (slt is an other instruction)
